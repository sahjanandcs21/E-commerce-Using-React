# React Ecommerce App Project for techcareer.net's Bootcamp

*I applied for a free of charge bootcamp, organized and instructed by techcareer.net and became one of 23 students selected out of 1700+ applicants.*

*This bootcamp was a 45 hour marathon, it was my first exposure to React.js and with the help of this bootcamp, I got comfortable using hooks,
javaScript array methods and writing custom CSS. Later I've refactored the code and implemented lazy loading on the products page, instead of
 retrieving all the products from the https://northwind.vercel.app/api/products I retrieve 10 products at a time as the user scrolls down, improving
 the performance of the website.*
### Important Note:

##### All products have the same image because northwind's api does not provide image data. I've researched some other API's with image data,
##### but I can't seem to find it suitable for my usecase, they were either extremely slow ( high latency ) or not descriptive enough docs or
##### paid / very limited number of requests per day.
